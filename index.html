          <h1>Fragrance</h1>
          <p>Fragrance is defined by the FDA as a combination of chemicals that gives each perfume or cologne (including those used in other products) its distinct scent. Fragrance ingredients may be derived from petroleum or natural raw materials.</p>
          <p>The words fragrance and scent are usually used synonymously, the difference is fine: while fragrance denotes a pleasant fragrance, scent is used for an unmistakable fragrance. Both refer to pleasant smells: while aroma refers more to plants, spices and food, fragrance is more associated with perfume and flowers.</p>
          <p>A fragrance is a smell, usually a pleasant or sweet smell. Often perfumes are called fragrances. If you like the fragrance of coffee, you like its smell. Unlike the word odor, which usually means a bad smell, fragrances are usually good smells.</p>
          <!--Basic smells List-->
          <p>Odors in the fragrant category included lavender, soap and cologne, while freshly cut grass and mushrooms gave off a woody/resinous smell. Eucalyptus, camphor and tea leaves were considered minty/peppermint scents. Sweet odors included vanilla, almond and chocolate. Kerosene and ammonia fell into the chemical category.20 sept. 2013</p>
